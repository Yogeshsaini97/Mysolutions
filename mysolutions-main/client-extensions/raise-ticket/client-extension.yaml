# Liferay workspace can build front end projects but does not know
#  which front-end build artifacts are relevant for your application.
#
#  This assemble block specifies which files need to be included
#  in the client extension build artifact. In this case we are specifying
#  the build/assets folder where our front-end build artifacts are created.
